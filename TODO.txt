TODO:
  HIGH PRIORITY:
	- Implement newsticker in Tacktech_Display.

  NORMAL PRIORITY:
	- Multiple playlists in Tacktech_Display should be able
	  to be played. Timed playlists must also be possible.

ISSUES:
	- Crash when none group edit playlist		-> Manager	[FIXED]
	- Crash if check for update before identify -> Server	[FIXED]
	- Filelist sent twice to Manager			-> Server/Manager	[FIXED]
	- Incorrect reporting of what is being 
	  played if the Display_Client is still
	  downloading data
	- Make newsticker text configurable via config file
